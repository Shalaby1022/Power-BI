# Power BI Employee Dataset Project

This repository contains a Power BI project that analyzes and visualizes employee information from a dataset. The project involves data normalization, transformation using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and creating an interactive dashboard with data visualizations and graphs.

Overview
The Power BI Employee Dataset Project aims to provide valuable insights into employee data through data modeling, calculations, and interactive visualizations. By leveraging the power of Power BI, the project offers an intuitive dashboard that enables users to explore and understand the dataset.

Features:

1- Data Normalization: The project involves the normalization of employee data to ensure consistency and eliminate redundancy.

2- Data Transformation with DAX: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to perform calculations, and aggregations, and create calculated columns and measures for effective data manipulation.

3- Interactive Dashboard: The Power BI report contains interactive visualizations and graphs that allow users to interact with the data dynamically.

How to Use:
1- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Shalaby1022/Power-BI.git
2- Open Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.
3- Connect to the dataset file located in the repository folder.
4- Explore the report to access the interactive dashboard and insights.

Dependencies
The project is built using Power BI Desktop and can be deployed to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.
